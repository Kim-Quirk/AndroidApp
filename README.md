# Overview

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game. This app allows a user to start a single-player or two-player tic-tac-toe game. The single player version plays against a simple AI. The app displays who wins (Xs or Os) and allows people to return to the menu to start the game over again.

I made this app to further my knowledge of the Kotlin language and to familiarize myself with Android Studio. This was my first time developing an app for any mobile device. I wanted to give it a shot and learn the basics.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}
